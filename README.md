# Meesho Mitra - AI-Powered FAQ Assistant

## Project Overview

Meesho Mitra is India's first FAQ-to-Friend GenAI bot designed to revolutionize e-commerce support for Tier-2 and Tier-3 users. This AI-powered assistant transforms traditional text-heavy FAQ sections into an intuitive, conversational interface that understands the unique needs of Bharat's diverse user base.

## Problem Statement

Traditional e-commerce FAQ systems present significant challenges for Indian users:
- Robotic and text-heavy interfaces that lack personalization
- Language barriers with English-dominated content
- Inability to address emotional and personalized queries
- Poor accessibility for non-technical users
- Ineffective in reducing product returns or boosting purchase confidence

## Solution Architecture

### Core Features

**Conversational FAQ Interface**
- Replaces static text with dynamic chat-based interactions
- Supports both voice and text inputs
- Hinglish-language processing for natural communication

**Visual Intelligence**
- Selfie-based style recommendations
- Moodboard inspiration matching
- Fabric quality assessment through image analysis

**Personalized Assistance**
- Context-aware responses based on user queries
- Product comparisons and recommendations
- Category-specific guidance (saree draping, kurta fitting)

**Platform Integration**
- Seamless WhatsApp handover for continued conversations
- Embedded within product pages for immediate access
- Mobile-optimized for low-data environments

## Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js with Rasa Webchat integration
- **AI/ML Models**: GPT-4 and Mistral LLMs with Hinglish optimization
- **Voice Processing**: Whisper API for multilingual speech-to-text
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI framework
- **Database**: Firebase for real-time analytics and personalization
- **External APIs**: Twilio for WhatsApp integration, Meesho Product APIs

### Key Components

1. **Intent Classification System** - Machine learning models for query categorization
2. **Product Recommendation Engine** - Cosine similarity algorithms with custom matching
3. **Multimodal Input Processor** - Unified handling of text, voice, and image inputs
4. **Context Management** - Session-based personalized assistance

## Business Impact

### Expected Metrics Improvement

- **20-30% reduction** in product return rates
- **3x increase** in FAQ section engagement
- **2x improvement** in pre-purchase customer confidence
- **40% decrease** in customer support ticket volume

### User Experience Transformation

Traditional FAQ Approach:
```
User: "Will this dress suit my wedding function?"
System: "Refer to product specifications"
Outcome: User confusion leading to cart abandonment
```

Meesho Mitra Approach:
```
User: "Ye meri shaadi ke liye accha rahega?"
Mitra: "Haan ji! This heavy work suit will be perfect for your wedding. 
       The color complements your skin tone based on your photo."
Outcome: Confident purchase decision
```
