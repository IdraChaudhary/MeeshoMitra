## Technical Implementation Details

### Hinglish Processing Pipeline

1. **Text Normalization**
   - Romanized Hindi to Devanagari conversion
   - Code-switching detection and handling
   - Slang and colloquialism mapping

2. **Intent Classification**
   - 15+ predefined intent categories
   - Confidence scoring for ambiguous queries
   - Fallback mechanisms for unrecognized inputs

3. **Entity Extraction**
   - Product attributes (color, size, fabric)
   - Occasion types (wedding, party, daily wear)
   - User preferences (style, budget, preferences)

### Recommendation Algorithm

```python
def generate_recommendation(user_query, user_context, product_catalog):
    # Step 1: Analyze user intent and preferences
    intent = classify_intent(user_query)
    preferences = extract_preferences(user_context)
    
    # Step 2: Filter relevant products
    candidate_products = filter_products(product_catalog, intent, preferences)
    
    # Step 3: Score and rank products
    ranked_products = score_products(candidate_products, user_context)
    
    # Step 4: Generate personalized explanation
    explanation = generate_reasoning(ranked_products[0], user_query)
    
    return ranked_products[:3], explanation
